# California housing dataset custom neural network
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the California housing dataset then after that I am using a custom neural network by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. using a deep neural network with:
    - custom loss function.
    - custom Activation Functions.
    - custom Initializers.
    - custom Regularizers.
    - custom Constraints.
    - custom metrics.
    - custom layers.
    - custom model.
